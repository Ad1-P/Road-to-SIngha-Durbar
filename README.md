# Road-to-SIngha-Durbar
Games are integral part of the entertainment sector in any humanâ€™s life. Annually, many games hit
the market with the hope to satisfy the entertainment needs of a human being. With 3d games and
first person games seemingly dominating the industry, it is well known that from the grass root
level it was initiated with the inception of legendary 2-d games.

Road to Singha Durbar, is a basic 2d game which is more of a learning curve. In this game,
avoiding obstacles and reaching the end point is the final goal. Extensive use of SFML has helped
to bring this game to life. In spite of the inclusion of animation and audio, this game still has this
basic 2d game vibe.

The goal of this game is finally to improve the basic understanding of C++ programming language
with the help of SFML with extensive use of the features of C++ programming language such as
inheritance.
